# INSync remediation progress

Updated 2026-10-07, Phases 0-4. Both audit and checklist read fully before edits.
Starting HEAD 75998c0; no applicable AGENTS.md in workspace/ancestors. Phase 0
left behavior unchanged, Phases 1-2 authored M01-M05 and affected UI, Phase 3
updates tooling, honest downloads, setup guard and bootstrap warning comments.
Phase 4 adds M06-M09, shared domain derivations and versioned document workflows.
No real project SQL/Auth/Storage execution, credential output or legacy row repair.

**Phases 0-4 complete.** All 39 findings remain tracked below: 3 Fixed,
25 Fixed-pending-live-verification, 11 Not-fixed for the stated later-phase work.
Known-defect characterization tests are not remediation evidence. Assumptions
are in DECISIONS.md. Stop after the Phase 4 commit and await the user's continue;
Phase 5 has not started. Earlier phase records below describe their then-current
state and are retained as history, including advisories resolved in Phase 3.

## Phase 0 artifacts and checks

- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `vitest.config.js`, `eslint.config.js`:
  Vitest, lint and test/watch scripts, isolated Node tests. Application build/dev
  configuration left intact. Vitest 4.1.11, ESLint/@eslint/js 9.39.5, React lint
  plugin 7.37.5, hooks plugin 7.1.1, globals 17.13.0 pinned as dev dependencies.
- `.env.example`: two public browser placeholders only; startup guard is Phase 3.
- `tests/setup.js`, `tests/audit-baseline.test.js`, `tests/README.md`: seven audit
  probes in 11 characterization cases with no live transport or app-client import.
- `supabase/inspection/01_metadata.sql`, `02_anomalies.sql`, `README.md`,
  `REPAIR_PROPOSAL.md`: unexecuted read-only catalog/anomaly inventory and per-group
  review proposal, covering duplicates, partial checklists, hour targets, role/
  assignment, rubric, time/review, paths/orphans and current-year flags.
- `supabase/tests/FIXTURES.md`: disposable role/status/scope fixture specification,
  full 12-table/Storage contract and RT-01 to RT-22 acceptance plan; not an executed
  policy suite. `supabase/RUNBOOK.md`: preparation gates only; migrations pending.
- `DECISIONS.md`: conservative defaults and implementation/change points.

Validation environment: Windows PowerShell, Node **24.18.0**, npm **11.16.0**.

| Check | Actual result / limit |
|---|---|
| Pre-edit `npm run build` | Passed, Vite 5.4.21, 673 modules. JS 931.35 kB / gzip 260.18 kB; CSS 22.80 kB / gzip 5.35 kB. >500 kB warning. |
| Post-edit `npm test` | Passed on Vitest 4.1.11: 1 file, 11 cases; known defects reproduced, synthetic SDK transport only. |
| Post-edit `npm run lint` | Passed: zero errors, six existing unused imports (3 Admin, 3 Instructor). Generated Vite timestamp config files excluded after one concurrent build/lint run raced a deleted temporary file. |
| Post-edit `npm run build` | Passed, 673 modules; same JS/CSS bytes, hashes and sizes as pre-edit baseline. >500 kB warning persists. Compilation only. |
| `npm ls --depth=0` | Passed with final pinned tooling; no invalid top-level dependency. |
| `npm audit --ignore-scripts` | Exit 1: 3 remaining packages, Vite (high), source-map-js (high), esbuild (moderate); existing Phase 3 debt. Initial 3.x Vitest trial added advisories and was replaced; none of those remain. No forced audit fix. |
| Lockfile/application diff | Existing production dependency versions unchanged; application source/bootstrap/legacy patch/Vite config unchanged. `git diff --check` passed. |
| Inspection/policy SQL | Authored and statically reviewed only; no Postgres parser/server/live result. Requires operator rehearsal on disposable data. |
| Browser / accessibility / real Auth / Storage | Not executed. |

ESLint 9 is marked unsupported by npm; latest 9.x retained for React lint plugin
peer compatibility. Reassess in Phase 3. Runtime floor mismatch and exposed dev
host remain open. Vitest has an independent nested Vite; root application Vite is
unchanged. No fresh Node 22 install/CI/browser validation is claimed.

## Phase 1 implementation and verification

Starting revision `368012c`. User authorized Phase 1 by “continue.” Deliverables:

- `supabase/migrations/M01_authority.sql`: single transaction with preflight drift/
  ownership/trigger checks, literal intern/Pending signup, requested_role metadata,
  status/assignment helpers, profile field guard, restricted profile/name access,
  immutable domain ownership, author-bound snapshot announcements, Active-scoped
  document Storage policies and explicit table/column/function/schema privileges.
- Raw clock/correction/document review writes revoked for every API role. Controlled
  clock, correction submission, atomic correction review, owner upload/reset and
  staff document-review RPCs preserve legitimate flows. Server instants/duration,
  explicit overnight end date and path-pinned review were prerequisite work pulled
  forward; unique/CHECK validation, trusted audit and full version lifecycle remain
  later phases. No legacy rows backfilled, merged or normalized.
- `src/lib/authority.js`, App, LoginPage, Intern/Instructor dashboards: status-only
  own-profile RPC, public effective role removed, staff FK name embeds replaced
  with restricted name RPC, controlled mutations, per-item bulk outcomes, UUID
  recipients, pending clock/review controls and outcome-dependent draft closing.
- `supabase/tests/baseline.sql`, `tests/m01-authority.test.js`: fresh synthetic
  Auth/Storage/domain schema and actual migration applied only in in-memory PGlite
  0.5.8. 1,716 raw CRUD matrix cases plus protected-field/RPC/catalog tests; all
  role/status variants have real owned fixture rows. Bootstrap never read/executed.
- Client transport suite verifies single-record/target assertions, thrown/returned
  errors and mixed bulk outcomes. Manila/overnight probes now assert corrected
  behavior through shared date/actual SQL; other baseline defects stay recorded.
- `supabase/tests/M01.md`, migrations README, RUNBOOK and DECISIONS updated with
  operator bootstrap, migration prerequisites, fail-closed rollback, live matrix,
  unknown legacy audience handling and conservative operation scope.

| Check | Phase 1 result |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | Final run: 3 files, 1,948 cases passed, including SQL-owner/name-scope hardening and one-second/future/required-note boundaries. Actual Postgres SQL tests and synthetic transport checks, not live Supabase. |
| `npm run build` | Passed: 674 modules, JS 930.86 kB / gzip 260.45 kB; CSS 22.80 kB / gzip 5.35 kB. Large-chunk warning persists. |
| `npm run lint` | Passed: zero errors, six existing unused imports. |
| `npm audit --ignore-scripts` | Exit 1: same 3 vulnerable packages (2 high, 1 moderate); Phase 3, no forced fix. No new runner advisory. |
| Source/data safety | Bootstrap/legacy patch unchanged; no .env contents, real credentials or remote DB/Auth/Storage contacted. No production migration applied. |
| Live/browser checks | Not run: actual JWT/confirmation, PostgREST composites/FK embedding, bucket public delivery/signed URLs, two-client concurrency, keyboard/mobile/screen-reader. Detailed steps in supabase/tests/M01.md. |

Known residual risks: bucket configuration may still be public (INS-015); trusted
audit is absent and Admin client logging remains forgeable (INS-009); legacy
uniqueness/CHECKs not enforced yet; document immutable version/staging cleanup and
rubric authority remain Phase 4; auth/read error handling and some zero-row writes
remain Phase 5. Extra live catalog drift causes M01 preflight to stop for review.
Local SQL success does not establish deployed authorization or production readiness.

## Phase 2 artifacts and checks

- `M02_trusted_audit.sql`: mandatory row-trigger audit across 11 business tables,
  trusted UID/time/source, protected INSERT and non-public trigger helper. Captures
  changed fields, role/status/assignment values and master labels without whole
  profile/file snapshots. Legacy audit remains explicitly unverified. Failed audit
  aborts the mutation; no-op/zero-row writes generate no event.
- M02 single review locks caller status/assignment/request and Pending transition,
  reconciles existing/missing attendance, stores required rejection/optional
  approval note, returns actual row. Server bulk uses per-item subtransactions
  and consistent intern/request lock order; no success for failed attendance/audit.
- `M03_attendance_integrity.sql`: daily/open/Pending unique identities after a
  duplicate preflight; NOT VALID interval/verification/reason/review CHECKs; future
  write trigger; server clock time captured after serialization; guarded row-ID
  closure. `M05_validate_attendance.sql` is a separately deferred historical gate,
  never a repair or timestamp guess. Any legacy anomaly remains an operator task.
- `M04_private_documents_bucket.sql`: separate explicit existing-bucket UPDATE,
  private/10 MiB/PDF-JPEG-PNG; no object cleanup. Independent of M03 legacy gate.
- `authority.js`, `attendance.js`, dashboards: strict server bulk outcomes,
  rejection-note draft/busy handling and persisted note/overnight end-date display;
  Manila clock/date/elapsed helpers; independent
  open-session query; Instructor Active Now across dates with unknown/error state.
  Removed client audit INSERT and fake import/backup events; disabled those two
  simulated actions and labeled backup unavailable/legacy audit provenance.
- `inspection/03_phase2_attendance.sql`, repair proposal, RUNBOOK, migration/test
  guides and D24-D27 cover anomaly review, staged validation and live limitations.
- Dev-only pinned embedded-postgres 17.10.0-beta.17 + pg 8.23.1; native disposable
  cluster accepts no remote URL/env credentials, runs hidden on random loopback
  port, creates no OS user/service, verifies cleanup paths. No bootstrap read.

| Check | Phase 2 result |
|---|---|
| `npm test` | 6 files / 2,012 tests passed: M01 SQL matrix 1,929; native Phase 2 SQL 45; migration gates 7; client transport 16; date/elapsed helpers 5; remaining baseline characterizations 10. Includes persisted deleted-master labels and final bulk scope/order checks. |
| Native races/faults | Overlap observed through pg_stat_activity waits; approve/approve, reject/reject, approve/reject, clock-in/out, Pending-submission races have one transition. Reassignment/deactivation while waiting denies stale review. Insert/update/review/audit failure rollback and mixed bulk tested. |
| `npm run build` | Passed: 675 modules; JS 933.62 kB / gzip 261.38 kB; CSS 22.88 kB / gzip 5.38 kB. Large-chunk warning remains Phase 6. |
| `npm run lint` | Passed: zero errors, six existing unused-import warnings. |
| `npm ls --depth=0` | Passed; test dependencies and existing React/Vite/plugins resolve without invalid top-level peers on Node 24.18.0. Runtime floor/tooling alignment remains Phase 3. |
| `npm audit --ignore-scripts` | Exit 1: same 3 vulnerable packages (2 high, 1 moderate), deferred Phase 3. No forced audit fix; test dependencies introduce no advisory in this report. |
| Safety / live limits | No .env read/output, real credentials, remote DB/Auth/Storage call or bootstrap execution. Local synthetic Auth/Storage metadata is not a deployed service. No browser/mobile/screen-reader run. |

Pending: operator catalog/anomaly review, all real migration application and
historical validation, genuine JWT/retained-session/API result shapes, Storage
public delivery denial/actual size-MIME enforcement, authorized signed URLs,
Supabase API races and browser/a11y. Private View/Download/version cleanup remains
Phase 4. Read failures/pagination/lifecycle/other zero-row handlers remain later
phases. New audit cannot certify previously authorized staff or historical claims.
No production-readiness or deployed-security claim.

## Phase 3 implementation and verification

Starting revision 74644c9. User authorized Phase 3 by continue.

- package.json/lock: application Vite 7.3.7, React plugin 5.2.0, esbuild 0.28.2,
  source-map-js override 1.2.2. Preserves esbuild pipeline rather than switching
  compiler architecture. No forced audit fix. Node floor >=22.12.0, .nvmrc 22,
  Windows CI matrix 22/24. Dev/preview host 127.0.0.1; no default network exposure.
- src/lib/config.js, supabaseClient.js, App.jsx, .env.example: format-checked public
  publishable/legacy anon setup; missing/malformed/private values never construct
  SDK; safe setup screen, constructor failures redacted. Format validation does
  not establish key authenticity or solve Phase 5 offline/auth state recovery.
- src/lib/exports.js and all three dashboards: actual blank planning CSV/XLSX,
  fresh all-authorized audit CSV and own all-record DTR CSV; keyset/API-cap/count/
  identity guards, role/status recheck, 50,000 limit, spreadsheet literal escaping,
  logged/verified/open/unknown evidence, real Blob dispatch/URL cleanup and busy/error
  state. Downloads are requested, never claimed saved. XLSX dependency loads on demand.
- Bulk import/file selection/drag-drop, instructor reports, intern PDF/Excel
  summaries/archives and certificates disabled and visibly unavailable. Removed
  fake certificate eligibility/download claims and uptime literal. Backup remains
  unavailable/not connected; no fake client audit writes reintroduced.
- Login demo shortcuts require explicit true AND development. Production test
  with flag true verifies all known demo account/password literals absent; generic
  sign-in placeholder. Real-account reuse inventory/rotation is an operator task.
- README, RUNBOOK, migration guide, PHASE3 verification and D28-D31 document setup,
  deployment, review/rehearsal/rollback and business defaults. Bootstrap and historical
  patch executable bodies unchanged; only destructive/superseded warning comments
  changed. No Phase 3 DB migration or bootstrap execution.

| Check | Phase 3 actual result / limit |
|---|---|
| npm test, Node 24.18.0 | 9 files, 2,061 cases passed (2,012 existing + 49 new). Includes synthetic SQL/races, export byte/ZIP/transport checks, actual App setup SSR with unrelated dashboards mocked, separate actual production build with demo flag true. |
| npm run build, Node 24 | Passed: Vite 7.3.7, 753 modules; main JS 935.73 kB / gzip 264.57 kB; lazy XLSX JS 71.27 kB / gzip 19.77 kB; CSS 22.77 kB / gzip 5.32 kB. Before Phase 3: JS 933.62 kB / gzip 261.38 kB, CSS 22.88 / 5.38. Large dashboard chunk persists, INS-036 Phase 6. |
| npm run lint | Passed, zero errors; same six existing unused-import warnings. |
| Clean install on Node 22.12.0 | Fresh disposable copy excluding ignored .env/node_modules/dist, npm ci succeeded; full 2,060 tests and build passed; audit zero. Final future-evidence regression also passes in the 2,061-case full suite on Node 22 from the workspace. Initial cold startup test timeout resolved by isolating unrelated dashboards. Windows TEMP 8.3 alias caused Vite HTML path mismatch; build passed from canonical long path. Use canonical workspace paths. |
| npm audit --ignore-scripts | Zero vulnerabilities, after upgrade and fresh Node 22 install. Point-in-time dependency snapshot only. |
| npm ls --all | Passed; no invalid dependency problems (also resolves former old root esbuild/optional-peer mismatch). |
| Source / SQL review | git diff --check passes; only comments change in legacy SQL, M01-M05 unchanged; no real Supabase project operations or .env contents read/output. |
| Remote CI / browser / live Supabase / a11y | Not executed. CI authored; PHASE3.md provides reviewable manual checks. Actual downloads, spreadsheet apps, valid-project/offline/auth flows, deployed RLS/Storage and screen readers remain unverified. |

Residuals: equal-count concurrent edits can yield mixed-time exports; no transactional
snapshot claimed (INS-027). Full dashboard totals/pagination/auth recovery remain
Phases 4/5. No importer, official certificate or backup implementation claimed.
ESLint 9 remains an unsupported-major notice while React lint plugin declares no
ESLint 10 support; no npm advisory currently. Provider backup status and old demo
password reuse must be checked by authorized operators. No production-ready claim.

## Phase 4 implementation and verification

Starting revision 6bc9bf5. User authorized Phase 4 by continue. Scope: INS-017,
018, 019, 020, 021, 022, 024 and 025; Phase 5 has not started.

- M06: strict target and rubric validators, NOT VALID historical checks, server
  weighted score/author, idempotent submission UUID and no raw evaluation writes.
  M09 separately validates reviewed clean history and applies score NOT NULL.
- M07: atomic Active Admin lifecycle/assignment with retained intern extension,
  Active instructor validation, explicit unassignment, protected raw-write
  revocation and deferred relationship invariants. Incompatible legacy references
  stop the migration unchanged; no silently normalized rows.
- M08: unique requirements after duplicate preflight, attach only missing standard
  types, generated upload reservations, exact MIME/size finalization, immutable
  committed versions and append-only review history, trusted reviewer/time,
  expected upload/review versions, constrained cleanup and short-lived access.
  Old path-only RPCs revoked; two new RLS tables and mandatory audit triggers.
  Restrictive document Storage guards cannot be OR-bypassed. No global document
  DELETE or overwrite; cleanup reconciles ambiguous outcomes before Storage API
  removal, preserves committed evidence and exposes unfinished-upload retries.
- business.js, hours.js, metrics.js, workflows.js: pure target/rubric/evidence/
  calendar/chart/clearance/risk rules shared by all dashboards and DTR export.
  Logged and verified hours separated, persisted target used, true Manila periods,
  year-aware sums, standard plus custom requirements and unknown legacy evidence.
  No fixed velocity. Count-checked prerequisite/feed reads bounded at 50,000.
- DocumentActions, EvaluationCriteria, AnnouncementsFeed and dashboards: private
  View/Download, expiration/retry and stale-link response guards; criteria/null
  handling; UUID recipient labels; loading/empty/error Retry/Refresh feed; busy
  new mutations, draft preservation and outcome-based state updates.
- inspection/04_phase4_domain.sql and PHASE4_REPAIR_PROPOSAL.md: read-only anomalies
  and review proposal before constraints. RUNBOOK, migration guide, PHASE4.md,
  README, tests/README and D32-D35 cover ordering, rollback, decisions and live
  acceptance. No legacy data repair, real project operation or dependency change.

| Check | Phase 4 actual result / limit |
|---|---|
| npm test, Node 24.18.0 | 13 files, 2,168 tests pass: 2,054 retained + 114 Phase 4 (34 business, 13 client, 4 migration-gate, 63 native SQL cases). Seven obsolete defect expectations replaced with desired behavior; three baseline probes remain. |
| Native overlap/faults | Seven separate-connection races observe lock waits and assert final outcomes; audit failure rolls back upload finalization, review, evaluation, account and assignment. Final-stage raw-write denial covers new evidence tables across API roles/statuses; catalog grants/owner/search_path and permissive-policy bypass tests pass. |
| npm run build | Passed, Vite 7.3.7, 761 modules; main JS 948.53 kB / gzip 269.21 kB, lazy XLSX 71.27 / 19.77, CSS 23.08 / 5.33. Before Phase 4 main JS 935.73 / 264.57. Large-chunk warning remains INS-036 Phase 6; compilation is not authorization proof. |
| npm run lint | Passed, zero errors, five pre-existing unused-import warnings (3 Admin, 2 Instructor). |
| npm audit --ignore-scripts | Zero vulnerabilities at this check; package.json/lock unchanged in Phase 4. No forced audit fix. |
| Migration safety | Actual M06-M09 run only on fresh synthetic local databases. Anomaly gates retain invalid legacy fixtures, failed validation rolls back and preserves NOT VALID new-write enforcement. Bootstrap/M01-M05 executable SQL unchanged. |
| Live Supabase / browser / screen reader | Not executed. PHASE4.md lists RT-05/07/14-17 plus role/status/Storage checks and actual provider byte cleanup, RPC shapes, signed delivery/expiry, real-client races, layout/keyboard checks. |

Residuals: operator must review legacy anomalies before unique constraints/M07
and historical M05/M09 validation; version-zero legacy evidence needs explicit
resubmission before new approval/clearance. Actual JWT/HTTP/Storage metadata and
file bytes remain unverified. MIME/size checks do not inspect content or scan for
malware. Signed links are bearer links until 60-second expiry. Review unrelated
bucket DELETE policies before M08's Storage table grant. Global advisory locking
is conservative and contention is unmeasured. Loaded metrics/read pages are not
transaction snapshots, cannot detect every equal-count edit and age until refresh;
server aggregates, general error states, pagination/focus/midnight refresh and auth
recovery remain Phase 5. Accessibility, current-year/admin completeness and lazy
chunks remain Phase 6. No certification, live security or readiness claim.

## Finding register

M01 refers to `supabase/migrations/M01_authority.sql`; SQL suite refers to
`tests/m01-authority.test.js`, client suite to `tests/authority-client.test.js`.
“Pending RT” means live verification, never a passing live test. Baseline probes
remain in `tests/audit-baseline.test.js`; local SQL checks are separate evidence.
